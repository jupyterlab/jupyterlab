 -# Personas
 -
 -## Experienced Data Scientist
 -
 -The Experienced Data Scientist has a graduate degree in a technical field and has
 -been coding for more than 5 years in multiple languages. They are in their mid 30s,
 -have a solid income and live in an urban setting. In the past they have used the
 -Jupyter Notebook alongside a text editor (Sublime Text) and the Terminal app on a
 -Mac. They love to code and feel at home in a terminal.
 -
 -**Goal:** Replace the usage of Mac's Terminal app, in particular when running
 -Jupyter on a remote system.
 -
 -Some things they would do in the terminal include:
 -
 -* Run command line git.
 -* Small amounts of general software engineering to support their data science, such
 -  as running test suites, moving files around at the command line.
 -* Run vim.
 -* Run command line IPython.
