An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the
Jupyter Notebook and Architecture. [Currently ready for users.](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)

[JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the next-generation user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) offering
all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,
terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and
powerful user interface.
JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook.

JupyterLab can be extended using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages
that use our public APIs. To find JupyterLab extensions, search for the npm keyword [jupyterlab-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension) or the GitHub topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/topics/jupyterlab-extension). To learn more about extensions, see the [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html).

The current JupyterLab releases are suitable for general
usage, and the extension APIs will continue to
evolve for JupyterLab extension developers.

Read the current JupyterLab documentation on [ReadTheDocs](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Getting started

### Installation

JupyterLab can be installed using `conda` or `pip`. For more detailed instructions, consult the [installation guide](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

Project installation instructions from the git sources are available in the [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### conda

If you use `conda`, you can install it with:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

### pip

If you use `pip`, you can install it with:

```shell
pip install jupyterlab
```

If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`. If you are using a Unix derivative (FreeBSD, GNU / Linux, OS X), you can achieve this by using `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` command.

#### Installing with Previous Versions of Jupyter Notebook

When using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, the following command must be run
after installation to enable the JupyterLab server extension:

```bash
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix
```

### Running

Start up JupyterLab using:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

JupyterLab will open automatically in the browser. See the [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html) for additional details.

If you encounter an error like "Command 'jupyter' not found", please make sure `PATH` environment variable is set correctly. Alternatively, you can start up JupyterLab using `~/.local/bin/jupyter lab` without changing the `PATH` environment variable.

### Prerequisites and Supported Browsers

The latest versions of the following browsers are currently _known to work_:

- Firefox
- Chrome
- Safari

See our [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) for additional details.

## Getting help

We encourage you to ask questions on the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/jupyterlab). A question answered there can become a useful resource for others.

### Bug report

To report a bug please read the [guidelines](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/issue.html) and then open a [Github issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). To keep resolved issues self-contained, the [lock bot](https://github.com/apps/lock) will lock closed issues as resolved after a period of inactivity. If related discussion is still needed after an issue is locked, please open a new issue and reference the old issue.

### Feature request

We also welcome suggestions for new features as they help make the project more useful for everyone. To request a feature please use the [feature request template](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).
