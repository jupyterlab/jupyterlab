/**
 * Interface of a Kernel connection that is managed by a session.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * The Kernel object is tied to the lifetime of the Kernel id, which is a
 * unique id for the Kernel session on the server.  The Kernel object manages
 * a websocket connection internally, and will auto-restart if the websocket
 * temporarily loses connection.  Restarting creates a new Kernel process on
 * the server, but preserves the Kernel id.
 *
 * The IKernelConnection is notably missing the full IKernel signals. This
 * interface is for situations where a kernel may change, but we want a user
 * to not have to worry about disconnecting and reconnecting signals when a
 * kernel is swapped. The object that maintains an IKernel, but only provides
 * a user with an IKernelConnection should proxy the appropriate IKernel
 * signals for the user with its own signals. The advantage is that when the
 * kernel is changed, the object itself can take care of disconnecting and
 * reconnecting listeners.
