JupyterLab Documentation

Welcome to the **JupyterLab** documentation site. JupyterLab is a highly
extensible, feature-rich notebook authoring application and editing environment,
and is a part of `Project Jupyter <https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/>`_, a
large umbrella project centered around the goal of providing tools (and `standards <https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#sub-project-documentation>`_) for interactive
computing with `computational notebooks <https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#what-is-a-notebook>`_.

A `computational notebook <https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#what-is-a-notebook>`_
is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions,
data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive
controls. A notebook, along with an editor like JupyterLab, provides a fast interactive
environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing
ideas with others.

JupyterLab is a sibling to other notebook authoring applications under
the `Project Jupyter <https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/>`_ umbrella, like
`Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and
`Jupyter Desktop <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop>`_. JupyterLab
offers a more advanced, feature rich, customizable experience compared to
Jupyter Notebook.

`Try JupyterLab on Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/demo>`__.  JupyterLab follows the Jupyter `Community Guides <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html>`__.
