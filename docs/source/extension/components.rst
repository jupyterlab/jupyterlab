Using JupyterLab components
===========================

JupyterLab is built with many re-usable components that are
independently `published on npm <https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jupyterlab>`_.
JupyterLab itself assembles these components together to provide a full,
IDE-like experience. However, developers are encouraged to use these to bring
to life their own visions of what a computational environment should look
like.

The JupyterLab repository has `many examples <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/main/examples>`_
to get you started.

The ``examples`` directory contains:

-  several stand-alone examples (``console``, ``filebrowser``,
   ``notebook``, ``terminal``)
-  a more complex example (``app``).

Installation instructions for the examples are found in the project's
README.

After installing the jupyter notebook server 4.2+, follow the steps for
installing the development version of JupyterLab. To build the examples,
enter from the ``jupyterlab`` repo root directory:

::

    jlpm run build:examples

To run a particular example, navigate to the example's subdirectory in
the ``examples`` directory and enter:

::

    python main.py

Dissecting the 'filebrowser' example
------------------------------------

The filebrowser example provides a stand-alone implementation of a
filebrowser. Here's what the filebrowserâ€™s user interface looks like:

Let's take a closer look at the source code in ``examples/filebrowser``.

Directory structure of 'filebrowser' example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The filebrowser in ``examples/filebrowser`` is comprised by a handful of
files and the ``src`` directory:

|filebrowser source code|

The filebrowser example has two key source files:

-  ``src/index.ts``: the TypeScript file that defines the functionality
-  ``main.py``: the Python file that enables the example to be run

Reviewing the source code of each file will help you see the role that
each file plays in the stand-alone filebrowser example.
