# Applying Custom CSS

To apply custom CSS, you can add a `/custom/custom.css` file in the
jupyter `config` directory. You can find the path, `~/.jupyter`, to
this directory by running `jupyter --paths`. There you can create a
folder named `custom` and create a `custom.css` file within the
folder.

Custom CSS is not loaded by default. In the jupyter configuration directory, the
`~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css` file will not be loaded unless the the application is
initialized with the `--custom-css` flag (`LabApp.custom_css` config).

# Jupyter Styling

You can use a custom CSS file to modify default Jupyter styling.

```{literalinclude} ../snippets/galata/test/documentation/data/custom-jupyter.css
:language: css
:lines: 6-
```

# Markdown

Another potential application for custom CSS is styling markdown.

```{literalinclude} ../snippets/galata/test/documentation/data/custom-markdown.css
:language: css
:lines: 6-
```
