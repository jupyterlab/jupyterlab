# Managing Kernels and Terminals

The Running panel in the left sidebar shows a list of all the kernels and
terminals currently running across all notebooks, code consoles, and
directories:

```{image} ../images/running-layout.png
:align: center
:alt: true
:class: jp-screenshot
```

:::{only} comment
Alt text is intentionally left blank because the image content is described directly prior.

(reopen-document)=

As with the classic Jupyter Notebook, when you close a notebook
document, code console, or terminal, the underlying kernel or terminal
running on the server continues to run. This enables you to perform
long-running actions and return later. The Running panel enables you to
re-open or focus the document linked to a given kernel or terminal:

```{raw} html
<div class="jp-youtube-video">
   <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gDM5lwU6Dmo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

The recently closed and currently open documents can be searched in the
modal view, which can be opened using a keyboard shortcut,
or by clicking the [â†—] icon in the running sidebar.

```{image} ../images/running-modal.png
:align: center

```

(shutdown-kernel)=

Kernels or terminals can be shut down from the Running panel:

```{raw} html
<div class="jp-youtube-video">
   <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PBDN9AJWBlw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

(shutdown-all-kernels)=

You can shut down all kernels and terminals by clicking the `X`
button:

```{raw} html
<div class="jp-youtube-video">
   <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tOjequ-46Qc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```
