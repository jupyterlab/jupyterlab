# Workspaces

A JupyterLab Workspace defines the layout and state of the user interface such as the position of files, notebooks, sidebars, and open/closed state of the panels.

Workspaces can be managed in three ways:

- {ref}`via Graphical User Interface <workspaces-gui>`
- {ref}`via Command Line Interface <workspaces-cli>`
- {ref}`via URL schema and parameters <url-workspaces>`

A workspace name may only contain ASCII letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), hyphen-minuses (`-`) and underscores (`_`).

## Managing Workspaces (GUI)

There are several commands for managing workspaces from the main menu, sidebar, and command palette:

- `create-new`, `clone`, `rename`, `reset`, and `delete` act on the workspaces stored by on the server in {ref}`the dedicated location <workspaces-directory>`.
- `save`, `save as`, `import`, and `export` can load and store the workspace to/from the file system (contained within the Jupyter root directory); `save` will save the workspace to the most recently saved file.

In the sidebar, in the "Running Terminals and Kernels" panel, under "Workspaces", the current workspace has a check mark (âœ“). Clicking on another workspace will open. Opening the context menu (right click) over the workspace item in the sidebar will present actions available for management of that workspace:

```{image} ../images/workspaces-sidebar.png

## Managing Workspaces (CLI)

JupyterLab provides a command line interface for workspace `import` and
`export`:

```bash
$ # Exports the default JupyterLab workspace
$ jupyter lab workspaces export
{"data": {}, "metadata": {"id": "/lab"}}
$
$ # Exports the workspaces named `foo`
$ jupyter lab workspaces export foo
{"data": {}, "metadata": {"id": "/lab/workspaces/foo"}}
$
$ # Exports the workspace named `foo` into a file called `file_name.json`
$ jupyter lab workspaces export foo > file_name.json
$
$ # Imports the workspace file `file_name.json`.
$ jupyter lab workspaces import file_name.json
Saved workspace: <workspaces-directory>/labworkspacesfoo-54d5.jupyterlab-workspace
```

The `export` command will generate a URL for any workspace you provide as an argument,
even if the workspace does not yet exist. Visiting a URL for a nonexistent workspace will create
a new workspace with that name.

The `import` functionality validates the structure of the workspace file and
validates the `id` field in the workspace `metadata` to make sure its URL is
compatible with either the `workspaces_url` configuration or the `page_url`
configuration to verify that it is a correctly named workspace or it is the
default workspace.

## Workspace File Format

A workspace file is a JSON file that contains one object with two required top-level keys, `data`, and `metadata`.

The `metadata` must be a mapping with an `id`
key that has the same value as the ID of the workspace. This should also be the relative URL path to access the workspace,
like `/lab/workspaces/foo`. Additionally, `metadata` may contain `created` and `last_modified` fields with date and time creation and most recent modification, respectively.
The date and time are encoded using ISO 8601 format, for example `2022-06-15T23:41:15.818986+00:00`.

The `data` key maps to the initial state of the `IStateDB`. Many plugins look in the State DB for the configuration.
Also any plugins that register with the `ILayoutRestorer` will look up all keys in the State DB
that start with the `namespace` of their tracker before the first `:`. The values of these keys should have a `data`
attribute that maps.

For example, if your workspace looks like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "application-mimedocuments:package.json:JSON": {
      "data": { "path": "package.json", "factory": "JSON" }
    }
  }
}
```

It will run the `docmanager:open` with the `{ "path": "package.json", "factory": "JSON" }` args, because the `application-mimedocuments` tracker is registered with the `docmanager:open` command, like this:

```typescript
const namespace = 'application-mimedocuments';
const tracker = new WidgetTracker<MimeDocument>({ namespace });
void restorer.restore(tracker, {
  command: 'docmanager:open',
  args: widget => ({
    path: widget.context.path,
    factory: Private.factoryNameProperty.get(widget)
  }),
  name: widget =>
    `${widget.context.path}:${Private.factoryNameProperty.get(widget)}`
});
```

Note the part of the data key after the first `:` (`package.json:JSON`) is dropped and is irrelevant.
