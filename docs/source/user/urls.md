# JupyterLab URLs

Like the classic notebook, JupyterLab provides a way for users to copy URLs that
open a specific notebook or file. Additionally, JupyterLab URLs are an advanced
part of the user interface that allows for managing workspaces. These two
functions -- file paths and workspaces -- can be {ref}`combined in URLs that open a
specific file in a specific workspace <url-combine>`.

(url-tree)=

## File Navigation with `/tree`

JupyterLab's file navigation URLs adopts
the nomenclature of the classic notebook; these URLs are `/tree` URLs:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/tree/path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

By default, the file browser will navigate to the folder containing the requested
file. This behavior can be changed with the optional `file-browser-path` query parameter:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/tree/path/to/notebook.ipynb?file-browser-path=/
```

Entering the above URL will show the workspace root folder instead of the `/path/to/`
folder in the file browser.

## Linking Notebook Sections

To create an URL which will scroll to a specific heading in the notebook append
a hash (`#`) followed by the heading text with spaces replaced by minus
characters (`-`), for example:

```none
/lab/tree/path/to/notebook.ipynb?#my-heading
```

To get a link for a specific heading, hover over it in a rendered markdown cell
until you see a pilcrow mark (`Â¶`) which will contain the desired anchor link:

```{image} ../images/notebook-heading-anchor-link.png
:alt: "A markdown cell with pilcrow mark (\xB6) which serves as an anchor link and\
:  \ is placed after a heading"
:class: jp-screenshot
```

:::{note}
Currently disambiguation of headings with identical text is not supported.
:::

JupyterLab experimentally supports scrolling to a specified cell by identifier
using `#cell-id=<cell-id>` Fragment Identification Syntax.

```none
/lab/tree/path/to/notebook.ipynb?#cell-id=my-cell-id
```

:::{note}
The `cell-id` fragment locator is not part of a formal Jupyter standard and subject to change.

(url-workspaces)=

## Managing Workspaces (URL)

JupyterLab sessions always reside in a workspace. Workspaces contain the state
of JupyterLab: the files that are currently open, the layout of the application
areas and tabs, etc. When the page is refreshed, the workspace is restored.

The default workspace does not have a name and resides at the primary `/lab`
URL:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab
```

All other workspaces have a name that is part of the URL:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/workspaces/foo
```

Workspaces save their state on the server and can be shared between
multiple users (or browsers) as long as they have access to the same server.

A workspace should only be open in a single browser tab at a time. If JupyterLab
detects that a workspace is being opened multiple times simultaneously, it will
prompt for a new workspace name.

(url-clone)=

## Cloning Workspaces

You can copy the contents of a workspace into another workspace with the `clone` url parameter.

To copy the contents of the workspace `foo` into the workspace `bar`:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/workspaces/bar?clone=foo
```

To copy the contents of the default workspace into the workspace `foo`:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/workspaces/foo?clone
```

To copy the contents of the workspace `foo` into the default workspace:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab?clone=foo
```

(url-reset)=

## Resetting a Workspace

Use the `reset` url parameter to clear a workspace of its contents.

To reset the contents of the workspace `foo`:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/workspaces/foo?reset
```

To reset the contents of the default workspace:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/workspaces/lab?reset
```

(url-combine)=

## Combining URL Functions

These URL functions can be used separately, as above, or in combination.

To reset the workspace `foo` and load a specific notebook afterward:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/workspaces/foo/tree/path/to/notebook.ipynb?reset
```

To clone the contents of the workspace `bar` into the workspace `foo` and
load a notebook afterward:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/workspaces/foo/tree/path/to/notebook.ipynb?clone=bar
```

To reset the contents of the default workspace and load a notebook:

```none
http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab/tree/path/to/notebook.ipynb?reset
```
