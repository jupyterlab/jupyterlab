Working with Files
==================

Opening Files
-------------

The file browser and File menu enable you to work with files and
folders on your system. This includes opening, creating, deleting,
renaming, downloading, copying, and sharing files and folders.

The file browser is in the left sidebar Files tab:

Many actions on files can also be carried out in the File menu:

   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot
   :alt: The File menu open including options like "New", "Save All."

.. _open-file:

To open any file, double-click on its name in the file browser:

.. raw:: html

     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rh-vwjTwBTI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

.. _newtab:

You can also drag a file into the main work area to create a new tab:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="jp-youtube-video">
     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uwMmHeDmRxk?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

.. _multiple-viewers:

Many files types have :ref:`multiple viewers/editors <file-and-output-formats>`.
For example, you can open a Markdown file in a :ref:`text editor <file-editor>` or as rendered HTML.
A JupyterLab extension can also add new viewers/editors for files.
To open a file in a non-default viewer/editor, right-click on its name in the
file browser and use the "Open With..." submenu to select the viewer/editor:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="jp-youtube-video">
     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1kEgUqAeYo0?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

.. _single-doc-sync:

A single file can be open simultaneously in multiple viewer/editors and
they will remain in sync:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="jp-youtube-video">
     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/87ALbxm1Y3I?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

.. _file-navigation:

The file system can be navigated by double-clicking on folders in the
listing or clicking on the folders at the top of the folder listing:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="jp-youtube-video">
     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OHwJzjG-l4?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

.. _file-share:

Right-click on a file or folder and select "Copy Shareable Link" to
copy a URL that can be used to open JupyterLab with that file or
folder open.

   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot
   :alt: The Copy Shareable Link option in the context menu of a file. Copy Shareable Link is the last entry on the list.

.. _file-copy-path:

Right-click on a file or folder and select "Copy Path" to copy the
filesystem relative path. This can be used for passing arguments to open
files in functions called in various kernels.
If you want to copy the filesystem absolute path, you must add the jupyterlab server config `LabServerApp.copy_absolute_path=True` and `ServerApp.root_dir = 'xxx'`.

Creating Files and Activities
-----------------------------

.. _file-create-plus:

Create new files or activities by clicking the ``+`` button at the top
of the file browser. This will open a new Launcher tab in the main work area,
which enables you to pick an activity and kernel:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="jp-youtube-video">
     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QL0IxDAOEc0?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

.. _file-create-menu:

You can also create new documents or activities using the File menu:

.. image:: ../images/files-create-text-file.png
   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot
   :alt: The context menu entry for creating a new file.

.. _current-directory:

The current working folder of a new activity or document will be the
folder listed in the file browser (except for a terminal, which
always starts in the root directory of the file browser):

.. raw:: html

  <div class="jp-youtube-video">
     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OfISSOTiGTY?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

.. _file-rename:

A new file is created with a default name. Rename a file by
right-clicking on its name in the file browser and selecting “Rename”
from the context menu:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="jp-youtube-video">
     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y3xzXelypjs?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

Uploading and Downloading
-------------------------

.. _file-upload:

Files can be uploaded to the current folder of the file browser by
dragging and dropping files onto the file browser, or by clicking the
"Upload Files" button at the top of the file browser:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="jp-youtube-video">
     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1bd2QHqQSH4?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

.. _file-download:

Any file in JupyterLab can be downloaded by right-clicking its name in
the file browser and selecting "Download" from the context menu:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="jp-youtube-video">
     <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wl7Ozl6rMcc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

Disabling File Uploads
----------------------

.. _file-disable-upload:

You can disable file uploads in JupyterLab through multiple mechanisms:

**Using the File Browser Settings**

The file browser includes an "Allow file uploads" setting that can be configured
in the Settings Editor (Settings → Settings Editor → File Browser), or by adding
the following configuration to your settings (Settings → Advanced Settings Editor → File Browser):

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@jupyterlab/filebrowser-extension:browser": {
       "allowFileUploads": false
     }
   }

When this setting is disabled, users will not be able to upload files either by
clicking the "Upload Files" button or by dragging and dropping files into the file browser.

**Removing the Upload Button via Settings**

You can also remove the upload button entirely in the file browser toolbar by adding the
following configuration to your settings (Settings → Advanced Settings Editor → File Browser):

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@jupyterlab/filebrowser-extension:widget": {
       "toolbar": [
         {
           "name": "uploader",
           "disabled": true
         }
       ]
     }
   }

This will hide the "Upload" button from the file browser toolbar, but
will not prevent drag-and-drop uploads unless the "Allow file uploads" setting
is also disabled.

**Combining Both Approaches**

For complete UI-level upload restriction, it is recommended to:

1. Disable the "Allow file uploads" setting (``allowFileUploads: false``) to
   prevent both button-based and drag-and-drop uploads in the file browser UI
2. Optionally disable the upload button in the toolbar using the configuration
   above to remove the UI element entirely

.. important::

   **UI-Only Restriction**

   These settings only disable the file upload functionality in the JupyterLab
   user interface. They do not prevent file uploads at the server level. If the
   Jupyter server allows file uploads through its API, users can still upload
   files programmatically (e.g., using the Contents API directly, through custom
   code, or via other clients).

   For true upload restriction, you must configure server-side permissions and
   access controls in addition to these UI settings. Consult the
   `Jupyter Server documentation <https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/>`_ for
   information on server-side security configurations.

Displaying Hidden files
-----------------------

Hidden files and folders can be displayed in JupyterLab by combining two parameters:

1. First the server should be allowed to serve hidden files by setting ``ContentsManager.allow_hidden = True``; see `server documentation <https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/configuration.html>`_.
2. Then you will be able to display or hide the hidden files through the menu ``View`` -> ``Show Hidden Files``.

Single-Click Navigation
-----------------------

Single-click navigation for files and folders can be enabled via the settings editor under the `File Browser` option: `Navigate files and directories with single click`
