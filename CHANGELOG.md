# JupyterLab Changelog

## v4.4

JupyterLab 4.4 includes a number of new features (described below), bug fixes, and enhancements.
This release is compatible with extensions supporting JupyterLab 4.0.
Extension authors are encouraged to consult the [Extension Migration Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_migration.html#jupyterlab-4-3-to-4-4) which lists deprecations and changes to the public API.

### Code console improvements

The code console prompt can now be positioned on the top, left, or right side of the console,
in addition to the default bottom placement. The placement is persisted in the Prompt Cell
Position setting.

The console toolbar now includes buttons to:
- Execute code
- Restart the kernel
- Clear the cells
- Switch the kernel

<img alt="The option to change console prompt position is available under the three dots button in the console toolbar, which is the last toolbar button" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.4-console.png" class="jp-screenshot">

Additional settings for console behavior have been added:
- Clear Code Content on Execute (enabled by default) – When disabled, the code submitted for execution remains in the code editor, allowing for further edits.
- Hide Code Input – When enabled, only the execution output is shown in the console.
- Clear Cells on Execute – When enabled, only the last cell is displayed.

Toggling all the three new settings transforms the console into an interactive editor
resembling an ephemeral notebook with a single cell.

### Settings import and export

Settings can now be exported to `overrides.json` from the Settings Editor,
which can be used to pre-configure defaults in deployments or to restore settings.

<img alt="The Import and Export buttons in the Settings Editor are the first two items in the toolbar panel" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.4-settings-import-export.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Workspace indicator

An opt-in workspace indicator is displayed on the top bar (next to the menu bar). It can be enabled
in the Settings → View → Appearance → Show Workspace Indicator.

<img alt="The workspace indicator in the open state" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.4-workspace-indicator.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Support for collaboration without `RTC:` drive

Real time collaboration in previous versions of JupyterLab
(which can be enabled by installing jupyter-collaboration package)
was implemented by swapping the default JupyterLab file system
drive to a collaborative drive with the `RTC:` prefix.
This approach was incompatible with multiple extensions.
JupyterLab 4.4 introduces the Content Providers API, which allows the next version of `jupyter-collaboration` to work without changing the drive prefix.
This improves compatibility with extensions that do not support arbitrary drives.

### Kernel subshells support

Kernel subshells, introduced in [JEP 91](https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/91-kernel-subshells/kernel-subshells.html),
enable concurrent code execution in kernels that support them.
When performing long-running computations (such as training a model), subshells enable users to:
- Use `ipywidgets` with updates displayed immediately
- Monitor kernel resource usage (e.g. memory usage)
- Invoke arbitrary commands (e.g., refine code for a subsequent cell) while maintaining live access to previously defined variables

Subshells are supported by `ipykernel` 7 (currently in alpha).

To create a subshell, open context menu (right-click)
over a notebook using a kernel supporting subshells
and select "New Subshell Console for Notebook".
A new console panel will open allowing access to variables from the main session.

<img alt="The subshell console" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.4-subshells.png" class="jp-screenshot">

JupyterLab can automatically create subshells for comm messages if kernels support this feature.
This enables concurrent execution of `ipywidgets` callbacks without requiring a user action.
This behavior can be changed from the settings, with options to:
- disable that feature to not use subshells for comms
- (default) automatically create one subshell per comm-target (e.g. one subshell for all `ipywidgets`)
- automatically create one subshell per comm (this can lead to issues if creating many comms)

### Context menu opt-out

The context menu, available under right mouse click in browsers, can now be disabled globally
by toggling the `Enable Context Menu` option available in the Command Palette,
or via the JSON Settings Editor in the Application Context Menu.

### Slimmer status bar

The terminals counter no longer appears in the status bar if no terminals are open.
The kernels counter can be disabled by toggling the "Show the status bar item" setting
in "Running Terminals and Kernels" (code name `showStatusBarItem`).

## v4.3

JupyterLab 4.3 includes a number of new features (described below), bug fixes, and enhancements.
This release is compatible with extensions supporting JupyterLab 4.0.
Extension authors are recommended to consult the [Extension Migration Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_migration.html#jupyterlab-4-2-to-4-3) which lists deprecations and changes to the public API.

### Minimap

The virtual scrollbar now acts as a minimap and exposes information on whether a cell:

- is running/scheduled (`[*]`), idle (`[ ]`) or was already run (e.g. `[1]`)
- was modified since it was last executed ("dirty") - orange background
- has an output that contains an error - red background
- is markdown/code (`[ ]`/`[*]`/`[1]` for code, nothing for markdown)
- how much text/code it contains

<img alt="The minimap view" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.3-minimap.png" class="jp-screenshot">

To enable the minimap, click on the hamburger icon (≡) which appears in the notebook's toolbar. If you do not see the hamburger icon, go to Settings → Notebook → Windowing mode and choose "full".

### Fullscreen mode

JupyterLab now offers two ways to toggle the full screen mode from within the application:
- using the `View` → `Appearance` → `Fullscreen Mode` menu entry
- using a customizable shortcut, by default <kbd>F11</kbd> (custom shortcuts are supported in Chrome, Safari and Edge)

### File browser enhancements

The file browser now:
- supports resizing the columns and remembers the column sizes after reloading JupyterLab
- supports uploading folders by drag-and-drop
- supports navigation with a single click (opt-in)
- has the file filter collapsed by default (funnel icon), increasing the space available

<img alt="The file browser with resize handle and filter funnel icon" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.3-filebrowser.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Server-side execution and collaboration

JupyterLab 4.2 added the option for extensions to implement server-side execution, which preserves
outputs created when the browser window is closed or disconnected.
The server-side execution builds on the same shared models API as the real-time collaboration (RTC).

This release includes additional work, improving both
the server-side execution and real-time collaboration (RTC) use cases:
- the intermediary state of streaming outputs is now optimized away preventing a memory leak when using shared models with long-running computations,
- the cell execution indicator (`[*]`) is now synchronized in the model, allowing collaborators to see that a cell is executed, and allowing server-side execution extensions to populate the state accordingly,
- the issue of spurious "File Change" dialog on save was addressed by enabling the collaborative models extension to update the document hash.

You can try these features by installing extensions:
- [`jupyter-server-nbmodel`](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-server-nbmodel)\* provides server-side execution for `jupyter-server`,
- [`jupyter-collaboration`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-collaboration) provides the real-time collaboration features,
- [`jupyverse`](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyverse) is an alternative server (a replacement for `jupyter-server`) which supports server-side execution.

\* while `jupyter-server-nbmodel` is developed by maintainers of JupyterLab, as of the JupyterLab 4.3.0 release date it is not an official Project Jupyter extension.

### Improved kernel and server interactions

The previous release enabled connecting to external kernels, such as those spawned by a third-party application like Blender.
In this release the kernel selector dialog was improved to also show the external kernels.

The previous release improved the awareness of the kernel/kernel specification distinction by providing both tree and list view in the kernels sidebar panel, but only the tree view featured the kernel identifiers.
In this release both the list and tree view show the kernel identifier stub.

A new toolbar button was added in the kernel allowing to shut down unused kernels (kernels with no widget attached).

<img alt="List view of the kernels in the sidebar, with the clear Shut Down Unused kernels button focused" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.3-kernels-sidebar.png" class="jp-screenshot">

The following dialog windows can now be dismissed or silenced:
- the "Server Connection Error" dialog now has an option to dismiss it for the duration of the session,
- the "Restart Kernel?" dialog now has an option to not ask again. This preference is persisted in settings ( `skipKernelRestartDialog`),

<img alt="The new options added in the server/session dialog windows" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.3-dialogs.png" class="jp-screenshot">

## v4.2

### Workspaces UI

It is now possible to switch and manage [workspaces](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/workspaces.html) from within JupyterLab.

<img alt="A context menu opened over the sidebar with workspaces list. The menu has options to manage the workspace over which it was opened - clone, rename, reset, delete, export, and import." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.2-workspaces-sidebar.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Recently opened/closed files

The [jupyterlab-recents](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-recents) extension was integrated into JupyterLab.

Users are now able to:

- re-open recently used files from the main menu:

   <img alt="An 'Open Recent' sub-menu in the 'File' menu allowing to re-open recently used files" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.2-recent-submenu.png" class="jp-screenshot">

- re-open recently closed files from the sidebar:

   <img alt="A new 'Recently Closed' section in the 'Running' sidebar" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.2-recent-sidebar.png" class="jp-screenshot">

- quickly jump to open tabs/recently closed files by using a new searchable modal dialog (press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to open the dialog, or click on the \[↗\] icon in the sidebar):

   <img alt="A modal dialog for quickly jumping to open/closed files" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.2-recent-modal.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Full notebook windowing mode by default

Notebooks in the `full` windowing mode only render the visible cells, significantly improving the performance of the application. One limitation of `full` mode is that the search function in your browser may produce false negatives; using the [JupyterLab search function](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/interface.html#searching) is recommended. To revert to the behaviour from JupyterLab 4.1, go to Settings → Settings Editor → Notebook, scroll to "Windowing mode", and choose `defer`.

### Improved Shortcuts Editor

Among the numerous improvements and bug fixes for the keyboard shortcuts editor:

- it is now possible to remove the default shortcuts,
- shortcuts are correctly sorted when using a language pack,
- shortcuts with different arguments are now correctly displayed as individual entries.

<img alt="A context menu opened over a keybinding in the Keyboard Shortcuts setting panel within the Settings widget" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.2-delete-shortcut.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Dark high contrast theme

A new theme, JupyterLab Dark High Contrast, which is intended to benefit users with the need for higher contrast, following the WCAG AAA accessibility standard for color contrast.
To select this theme, from the menu bar, choose Settings → Theme → JupyterLab Dark High Contrast. Please provide feedback and suggestions on further improvements to this theme.

<img alt="A dark high contrast theme" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.2-dark-high-contrast.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Keyboard shortcuts improvements

Following feedback from users, implementation of certain shortcuts was moved from the CodeMirror editor to JupyterLab shortcut system, allowing for better integration:

- the shortcut for deleting a line was restored to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> as in JupyterLab 3.x; the shortcut for extending (multi-cursor) selection was remapped to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>. The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> shortcut can also be used for deleting lines for compatibility with other editors.
- the shortcuts for toggling line comments (by default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd>) and block comments (by default <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>) can be customized in the Shortcuts Editor, enabling users of non-US keyboards to adjust the keybinding to one optimal on their keyboard layout. Please note that the block comment only works in languages which have a dedicated block comment syntax defined in the CodeMirror language data (e.g. C, JavaScript, but not Python). The line comment shortcut can be also used to comment out multiple lines.

## v4.1

JupyterLab 4.1 includes a number of new features (described below), bug fixes, and enhancements for extension developers. This release is compatible with extensions supporting JupyterLab 4.0. Extension authors are recommended to consult the [Extension Migration Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_migration.html#jupyterlab-4-0-to-4-1) which lists deprecations and changes to the public API.

### Custom CSS

JupyterLab now supports automatic loading of custom CSS.
Themes are the recommended way for customizing the JupyterLab look and feel,
while custom CSS is intended for minor personal adjustments.

To opt in, start JupyterLab with the `--custom-css` flag.
The location of the `custom.css` file is documented in the section on [customizing the user interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/interface_customization.html#custom-css).

```{note}
`custom.css` is also available in Jupyter Notebook;
while similar selectors can be used for components shared between JupyterLab 4.1 and Jupyter Notebook 7.0,
there was a different set of selectors in Notebook 6 and older versions.
Users with the custom CSS file using the selectors from legacy Notebook versions
will need to update them and note that tutorials may refer to the selectors for the old Notebook versions.
```

### Diagrams in Markdown

Matching GitHub-Flavoured Markdown, JupyterLab 4.1 now supports [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) diagrams.
To create a mermaid diagram use the `mermaid` language specifier for a code block in a markdown cell or document, for example:

~~~
```mermaid
flowchart LR

A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
B --> C{Decision}
C -->|One| D[Result 1]
C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```
~~~

which renders as:

<img alt="Rendered Mermaid diagram going from left to right with modern look; the diagram contains blueish square node with text Hard pointing to round square node with text Round; over the arrow connecting the two nodes there is a word Text; the second node further connects to a rhombus-shaped node with text Decision which then connects to two further nodes, Result 1 and Result 2." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.1-merimad-diagram.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Inline completer

JupyterLab now supports completion presented as ghost text in the cell and file editors,
allowing generative AI models to provide multi-line completions.
The suggestions are provided by plugins implementing the ``IInlineCompletionProvider`` API;
by default a single provider which uses kernel history is available.

<img alt="In a code cell with `def fac` content a ghost text containing a suggestion representing further code of factorial function is shown; over the code cell there is a floating widget allowing to accept the suggestion and iterate between alternative suggestions" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.1-inline-completer.png" class="jp-screenshot">

The suggestions can be invoked as-you-type or manually using a configurable shortcut (by default <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>\\</kbd>).
The default keyboard shortcuts are displayed in the small widget shown when hovering over the ghost suggestion:
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>End</kbd> - accept suggestion
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd> - previous suggestion
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd> - next suggestion

To enable the inline suggestions based on the kernel history, go to Settings → Inline Completer → History provider → check the "enabled" checkbox.

In addition to the built-in history suggestions,
the [`jupyter-ai`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai) extension can provide
suggestions from supported models.
The `jupyter-ai` integration with inline completer is available starting with the
[v2.10.0](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai/releases/tag/v2.10.0) release.

The Inline Completer API is still considered experimental and may be subject to changes, please share feedback!

### Keyboard navigation improvements

Numerous improvements to keyboard navigation with focus on accessibility and usability are included in this release:
- the notebook cells now retain focus
- the focus can now be moved beyond the active notebook
- the toolbars can now be navigated using arrow keys

For more details, see [this post on the Jupyter Blog](https://blog.jupyter.org/recent-keyboard-navigation-improvements-in-jupyter-4df32f97628d).

### Execution history in notebook

The code from previously executed cells can be used to populate empty cells,
allowing to iterate on code from previous cells or even previous sessions
(depending on how a specific kernel stores history).

To cycle between history items, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd> and  <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd>.

To enable execution history, go to Settings → Notebook → check the "Kernel history access" checkbox.

This feature was already available in the console in previous releases; it only works with kernels supporting execution history requests.
To clear the execution history, consult the documentation of the kernel you are using (e.g., IPython/ipykernel).

### Opening files from tracebacks

Paths to code files detected in tracebacks returned by kernels on execution error are now turned into links.
These links will open the corresponding file for editing, if it is in the Jupyter root directory,
or they will open a read-only preview if the file is outside of the root directory and the active kernel supports the debugger.

<img alt="A link to the file with definition of imported module is shown in the traceback" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.1-traceback-links.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Error indicator in the table of contents

When a cell fails during execution, an error indicator will be displayed by the corresponding heading,
increasing awareness of the notebook state and enabling users to quickly navigate to the cell which requires attention.

<img alt="Error indicator in the shape of a triangle with exclamation sign (using ⚠ UTF character) shown next to one of the headings in the table of contents panel" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.1-toc-error-indicator.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Plugin Manager

Individual plugins can now be disabled or enabled from a new Plugin Manager user interface.
Each extension is composed of one or more plugins, and plugins form the basis of JupyterLab itself,
thus the plugin manager enables more extensive customization of the JupyterLab experience.

<img alt="An example search result in the plugin extension listing" src="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/plugin-manager-search-notebook.png" class="jp-screenshot">

This feature is intended for advanced users and is documented in depth in the [documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html#managing-plugins-with-plugin-manager).

Administrators may want to [lock specific plugins](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html#locking-and-unlocking-plugins) if they are required for any reason; this will prevent users from disabling the plugins via Plugin Manager and remote API calls. The Plugin Manager itself can be [disabled using the CLI](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html#enabling-and-disabling-extensions).

### Virtual scrollbar for notebook in windowed mode

The windowed notebook received an optional scrollbar delineating the active cell and selected cells.
Users can jump to a specific cell.

<img alt="Virtual scrollbar shown on the right side of notebook" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.1-virtual-scrollbar.png" class="jp-screenshot">

To enable the virtual scrollbar, go to Settings → Notebook → Windowing mode, choose "full", and click on the hamburger icon (≡) which appears in the notebook's toolbar.

Virtual scrollbar is considered experimental, please share feedback!

### Notifications

JupyterLab 3.6 added a notification center which so far was only used for announcements and version update notifications (both opt-in).
JupyterLab 4.1 adds two notifications to guide users in potentially confusing situations:
- when a user attempts to save a read-only document, a transient notification suggesting using "save as" is displayed
- when a user attempts to execute a cell before a slow-starting kernel has initialized, a notification is shown to indicate that the cell cannot be yet executed (this is opt-in and needs to be enabled in settings)

### Full notebook windowing mode improvements

Notebooks in the `full` windowing mode only render the visible cells, significantly improving the performance of the application.
Numerous improvements for the full windowing mode behaviour (such as scrolling, search, rendering, and navigation) are included in this release (see the list of issues in [#15258](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/15258) for details).

```{note}
The windowing mode is still experimental and known issues remain to be solved
([#15415](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/15415), [#15465](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/15465),  [#15594](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/15594)).
In addition, a sporadic regression in cell ordering ([#15610](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/15610)) was observed in 4.1 beta,
and remains to be fixed, pending reports from users willing to test the windowing mode in JupyterLab 4.1 to help create reproducible steps that would enable fixing this issue.

Users who already enabled this mode in previous versions are advised to evaluate the benefits of fixes included in 4.1 against regressions linked above before deciding to upgrade.
```

### Search improvements
- The search box will now grow automatically to accommodate longer text
- Search in selection can now be toggled using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> and automatic search in selection can be configured in settings
- Tooltips with shortcuts were added to the buttons in the search box to improve discoverability of the shortcuts

### Miscellaneous
- The current theme (dark/light) can now be synced with the browser/system preference (Settings menu → Theme → Synchronise with System Settings)
- A blue "read-only" status indicator is now  displayed in the toolbar of documents which cannot be saved because their model is read-only.
- Native support for viewing jsonl/ndjson files was added
- Collapsing of breadcrumbs in the File Browser can be disabled in File Browser settings
- Extension manager can now use a HTTP proxy for fetching extensions

### Moved plugins

Some internal JupyterLab plugins have been re-organized to allow for better flexibility for deployments and downstream applications like Notebook 7. This might affect users that disable specific plugins with the `jupyter labextension disable` command or the `disabledExtensions` config option.

- The `help:open` command is not defined in the `@jupyterlab/help-extension:resources` plugin anymore, but has been moved to a new `@jupyterlab/help-extension:open` plugin instead.

## v4.0

### 4.0.0 - Highlights

Below are the major highlights in JupyterLab 4.0.0.

#### New text editor

CodeMirror, the text editor used for cells and file editors, has been updated to [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/). This brings important
accessibility and performance improvements as well as better customization capabilities.
We have also improved the editor settings. Previously, users had to customize settings separately for each type of cell, the file editor, and the console editor. Now, you can change your settings in one place. It is now easier to use the default settings for all editors and to change some settings for specific cases. For example, you can now hide line numbers only for markdown cells.

Developers can now provide editor extensions, like themes and programming language parsers, through new application registries.

#### New extension manager

Starting with JupyterLab 3, extensions can be installed via Python packages
(or other providers of [prebuilt extensions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_dev.html#prebuilt-extensions)).

In JupyterLab 4, building on this feature, the Extension Manager now includes extensions from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab).
This removes the build step from installation of extension when using Extension Manager.

Developers can provide an alternative package repository to display their own set of extensions.

#### Improved document search

The Search and Replace functionality has been improved with new features when searching in a notebook:

- Highlight matches in rendered markdown cells
- Search in selection
- Multi-line search
- Replace using regex capture-group references
- Replace while preserving case

#### UI improvements

Some new elements have been added or changed in the UI:

- Rework the running kernels section
- "Add a new cell" button at the bottom of a notebook
- Dialog to display keyboard shortcuts as in the Classic Notebook (use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>)
- Display the first line of cell input and outputs when they are collapsed

#### Accessibility improvements

JupyterLab is not yet fully accessible. Currently, we are focused on making Notebook 7 accessible.
A big part of the code is shared, though, and the following accessibility improvements are in JupyterLab 4:

- Improved focus and keyboard navigation in the file browser
- More ARIA roles and labels were added to UI elements
- Main menu collapses to a hamburger menu if there is not enough space to display all items.

#### Performance enhancements

JupyterLab is now faster, thanks to the following improvements:

- CSS rules optimization: CSS selectors have been optimized to improve web browser performance when many elements are present on a page.
- Upgrade to CodeMirror 6: Especially for notebooks with many cells, the new CodeMirror version is far more efficient than the previous version. Large notebooks should load more quickly.
- Upgrade to MathJax 3: The mathematical equations renderer library has been been upgraded from v2 to v3 allowing faster rendering.
- Notebook windowing: By rendering only the parts of a notebook that fit in the web browser viewport, JupyterLab is much more efficient. See an important note below.

Notebook windowing _might_ add side effects for example if some cell outputs are displaying [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). Therefore it is not yet the default value. But we recommend user to switch to it and report bugs to help us polish it. To test it, you
need to set the user setting _Notebook_ > _Windowing mode_ to `full`.  If you have issues with notebook rendering, try changing back to `defer` or `none`. (`none` should be used as a last resort, because it disables all optimizations.)

#### Real Time Collaboration

JupyterLab 3.6 already made significant improvements to the Real Time Collaboration (RTC) feature.
The feature is now in a separate repository: [jupyter_collaboration](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter_collaboration).
The rationale is to limit the dependencies for users who don't need RTC. Separating RTC also helps organizations using JupyterLab that do not meet the specific requirements regarding file content management.

To enable RTC, install the `jupyter-collaboration` package with either `pip` or `conda`.

- with pip: `pip install "jupyter-collaboration>=1.0.0a0"`
- with conda: _not yet available_

RTC highlights in the standalone `jupyter-collboration` package, version 1.0.0, include:

- Support for displaying multiple cursors and selections
- Support for registration of new shared model types

#### For developers

Here are the main tool updates that will benefit extension authors and developers:

- TypeScript v5
- Yarn v3
- React v18
- Lumino v2

We recommend using Node.js v18 or newer, because older versions will reach end of life in 2023 or earlier (see [Node release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)).

To ease code migration to JupyterLab 4, developers should review the [migration guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_migration.html). A few existing extensions have already been migrated and can be used as examples:
- the [JupyterLab Extensions by Examples](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/pull/232)
- the [Jupyter MIME type renderers](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers/pull/296)

## 3.1.0

([Full Changelog](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/compare/v3.0.6...60f37be54a714c391fad5500cb57055af1492591))

### User-facing changes

- From JupyterLab 3.1, file documents and notebooks have collaborative
  editing using the [Yjs shared editing framework](https://github.com/yjs/yjs).
  Editors are not collaborative by default; to activate it, start JupyterLab
  with the `--collaborative` flag. See full documentation on [collaboration](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/rtc.html).
- The undo/redo history in the notebook is now document-wide (tracking changes across all cells); the future verisions will enable restoring the previous behaviour of per-cell undo/redo.
- Table of Contents received multiple new features and settings described in the [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/toc.html).
- The debugger received many improvements, including basic support for evaluating code at a breakpoint, and for variable inspection.
- The closing bracket is no longer automatically added by default; the old behaviour can be re-enabled from the menu bar (`Settings` -> `Auto Close Brackets`) or from the Advanced Settings Editor.
- A new visual indicator was introduced to highlight cells in which the code changed in the editor since last execution:
  <img alt="A GIF of the visual indicator showing up after editing a cell." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21197331/120619861-ae957d80-c45c-11eb-8640-b25b8b659ad4.gif">
- Many other new features were added as documented below.

### v3.0.0

### User-facing changes

#### Extensions can be installed without building JupyterLab with NodeJS

In JupyterLab 3.0, a new recommended way of distributing and installing
extensions as Python pip or conda packages is available. Installing such
extensions does not require rebuilding JupyterLab and does not require
having NodeJS installed. The previous way of distributing extensions as
npm packages requiring rebuilding JupyterLab is still available as well.
See the
[documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html#extensions)
for more details.

#### The JupyterLab interface supports multiple languages

JupyterLab now provides the ability to set the display language of the
user interface. See the
[documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/language.html)
for more details.

#### A new visual debugger

JupyterLab now ships with a debugger front-end by default, available for
kernels that support the new debugging protocol. See the
[documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/debugger.html)
for more details.

#### Improvements to Simple Interface mode and Mobile

The Simple Interface mode (previously Single Document Mode) is now more
streamlined. JupyterLab now supports showing the current file in use in
the browser URL bar, similar to the classic Jupyter Notebook.

#### Table of Contents is now in core

The popular Table of Contents extension is now part of core JupyterLab.
This core extension makes it easy to see an outline view of notebooks
and other documents.

#### Visual filter in file browser

The file browser now has a filter input which filters the list of files
using the same fuzzy matching as the command palette.

#### Property inspector moved to right sidebar

The default interface for JupyterLab now has system-wide sidebar panes
on the left side and sidebar panels that interact with a specific
document (such as the debugger or notebook property inspector) on the
right side. As always, you can move panes between the left and right
sidebars (right click on the sidebar icon, or change it in Advanced
Settings).

#### Command Palette

The command palette is now a floating window that appears on top of your
JupyterLab workspace. This enables users to quickly invoke a command
while keeping the sidebar closed or switching sidebar panels. The
command palette can be put back into the sidebar by adjusting the
default in Advanced Settings.

#### Jupyter Server

JupyterLab 3.0 now depends on [Jupyter
Server](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io), which is a new Jupyter
project based on the server portion of the classic Notebook server. See
the [Migration
Guide](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operators/migrate-from-nbserver.html)
to migrate custom notebook configuration to Jupyter Server.

### For Developers

#### Prebuilt Extensions

Users will typically consume prebuilt extensions, which are Python
packages with static assets built using `JupyterLab`. See the updated
APOD tutorial for the workflow of creating a prebuilt extension from
scratch. For existing extensions, there is a new
`python -m jupyterlab.upgrade_extension` script that can be used to
upgrade extensions. The script will update the relevant dependencies and
add the boilerplate to create the Python package. For extensions that
already contained Python packages (typically server extensions), the
files are not overwritten, and some manual copying of content is
required. See the
[example](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/pull/119),
which used this script heavily. There are two highlighted commits that
demonstrate upgrading a server extension. Prebuilt extensions are also
known as federated extensions in the changes below, since they use the
federated module capability in Webpack 5.

- Better handling of extensions that provide both prebuilt and source
  extensions.

  [#5694](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5694))

### Extension Development Changes

- We have rewritten how extensions provide keyboard shortcuts and
  interact with the settings system. If you previously defined
  keyboard shortcuts or used the settings mechanism, you will need to
  update your extension
  ([#5470](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5470),
  [#5298](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5298))
- We have renamed the plugin type from `JupyterLabPlugin` to
  `JupyterFrontEndPlugin`. The application arg is also renamed from
  `JupyterLab` to `JupyterFrontEnd` and some its functionality has
  been moved to a separate `ILabShell` plugin
  ([#5845](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5845),
  [#5919](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5919))
- The lab shell `addToMainArea`, `addToLeftArea`, `addToTopArea`,
  `addToRightArea`, and `addToBottomArea` functions have been replaced
  with a single `add()` function that takes the area as an argument.
  Replace `addToMainArea(widget, options)` with
  `add(widget, 'main', options)`, etc.
  ([#5845](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5845))
- Rename `pageUrl` to `appUrl` in the server connection
  ([#6509](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6509),
  [#6508](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6508),
  [#6585](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6585),
  [#6584](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6584))
- `MainAreaWidget` instances now forward update requests to their
  `content`
  ([#6586](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6586),
  [#6571](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6571))
- The theme data attributes are renamed and moved to the document body
  element. If you are relying on these attributes in CSS to
  conditionally style based on the theme, you should update their
  names. For example `data-theme-light` is now `data-jp-theme-light`.
  ([#6566](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6566),
  [#6554](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6554))
- Extensions which require CSS should no longer import their CSS files
  into their Javascript files. Instead, they should specify a root CSS
  file in the `style` attribute in their `package.json`, and
  JupyterLab will automatically import that CSS file.
  ([#6533](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6533),
  [#6530](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6530),
  [#6395](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6395),
  [#6390](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6390))
- `Dialog.prompt` has been replaced by a number of type-specific
  dialogs such as `InputDialog.getString`, `InputDialog.getBoolean`,
  etc. ([#6522](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6522),
  [#6378](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6378),
  [#6327](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6327),
  [#6326](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6326))
- When a `RenderMime` widget is re-rendered, the default behavior is
  to remove any existing content in the DOM. This can be overridden if
  needed.
  ([#6513](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6513),
  [#6505](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6505),
  [#6497](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6497))
- We have updated our internal TypeScript version to 3.5.1 and our
  compile target to `ES2017`. Extensions may need to upgrade their
  TypeScript version and target as well.
  ([#6440](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6440),
  [#6224](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6224))
- We have updated the typings for some of the Kernel messages so that
  they better match the spec.
  ([#6433](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6433))
- A `connectionFailure` signal has been added to some of the manager
  classes, which can be used to detect when a connection to the server
  is lost
  ([#6399](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6399),
  [#6176](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6176),
  [#3324](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3324))
- Add rate limiting and polling utilities to `coreutils` to use for
  throttling and debouncing of API requests
  ([#6345](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6345),
  [#6346](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6346),

  ,[#6305](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6305),
  [#6157](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6157))
- Require session when instantiating terminal widget
  ([#6339](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6339),
  [#5061](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5061))
- Provides a signal to see what items are opened in a directory
  listing
  ([#6270](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6270),
  [#6269](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6269))
- Ads the ability to add widget above the main work area to a top
  header area
  ([#5936](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5936))
- Renames `contextMenuFirst` to `contextMenuHitTest` in the
  `JupyterFrontEnd`
  ([#5932](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5932))
- Removes the `initialCommand` arg from the terminal creation command.
  ([#5916](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5916))
- Adds `--jp-code-cursor-width0`, `--jp-code-cursor-width1`, and
  `--jp-code-cursor-width2` variables to the themes to support
  changing the cursor width if you change the font size
  ([#5898](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5898))
- Adds the ability to insert a new item to the toolbar before or after
  another item
  ([#5896](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5896),
  [#5894](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5894))
- Adds the ability for extensions to register new CodeMirror modes
  ([#5829](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5829))
- We have removed the `JUPYTERLAB_xxx_LOADER` Webpack loaders, instead
  you should use the loader directly in the URL as Webpack supports it
  ([#5709](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5709),
  [#4406](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4406))
- Adds the ability to handle fragments for document widgets
  ([#5630](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5630),
  [#5599](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5599))
- We have added a `@jupyterlab/ui-components` package that contains
  reusable React components to be used internally and in extensions.
  Feel free to use this to create extension UIs with consistent styles
  ([#5538](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5538))
- The `showErrorMessage` function now lets you customize the buttons
  it uses
  ([#5513](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5513))
- We now provide helpers for using React components within JupyterLab.
  If you were previously using `ReactElementWidget` you should switch
  to using `ReactWidget`.
  ([#5479](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5479),
  [#5766](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5766),
  [#6595](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6595),
  [#6595](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6595))

  ([#5460](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5460),
  [#5388](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5388))
- Creating a new services session now requires passing a kernel model
  instead of a kernel instance
  ([#6503](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6503),
  [#6142](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6142))
- We upgraded the Webpack raw file loader. The new version of the raw
  loader exports ES2015 modules, so this may require changes in
  extensions that import files using the raw loader. For example, if
  you did `require('myfile.md')` to get the content of
  `myfile.md` as a string, you now should import it using
  ES2015 `import` syntax, or use
  `require(\'myfile.md\').default`.
- Widget factories now can support custom cloning behavior from an
  optional source widget
  ([#6060](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6060),
  [#6044](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6044))
- We have renamed the type `InstanceTracker` to `WidgetTracker`
  ([#6569](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/commit/da8e7bda5eebd22319f59e5abbaaa9917872a7e8)).
- In order to add widgets to the main area (e.g. as in the old XKCD
  extension tutorial), the correct syntax is now
  `app.shell.add(widget)` or `app.shell.add(widget, 'main')`, see
  [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/da8e7bda5eebd22319f59e5abbaaa9917872a7e8/packages/application/src/shell.ts#L500).

  [#5257](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5257))

### For Developers

- Default toolbar buttons can be overridden, and mime renderers can
  now specify toolbar buttons.
  ([#5398](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5398),
  [#5370](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5370),
  [#5363](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5363))
- A JupyterLab application instance can now be given a document
  registry, service manager, and command linker.
  ([#5291](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5291))

## [v0.34.0](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/releases/tag/v0.34.0)

### August 18, 2018

See the [JupyterLab
0.34.0](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/milestone/16?closed=1)
milestone on GitHub for the full list of pull requests and issues
closed.

### Key Features

- Notebooks, consoles, and text files now have access to completions
  for local tokens.
- Python 3.5+ is now required to use JupyterLab. Python 2 kernels can
  still be run within JupyterLab.
- Added the pipe (`|`) character as a CSV delimiter option.
- Added "Open From Path..."" to top level `File` menu.
- Added "Copy Download Link" to context menu for files.

### Changes for Developers

- Notebooks, consoles, and text files now have access to completions
  for local tokens. If a text file has a running kernel associated
  with its path (as happens with an attached console), it also gets
  completions and tooltips from that kernel.
  ([#5049](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5049))

- The `FileBrowser` widget has a new constructor option
  `refreshInterval`, allowing the creator to customize how often the
  widget polls the storage backend. This can be useful to prevent
  rate-limiting in certain contexts.
  ([#5048](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5048))

- The application shell now gets a pair of CSS data attributes
  indicating the current theme, and whether it is light or dark.
  Extension authors can write CSS rules targeting these to have their
  extension UI elements respond to the application theme. For
  instance, to write a rule targeting whether the theme is overall
  light or dark, you can use

  ```css
  [data-theme-light='true'] your-ui-class {
    background-color: white;
  }
  [data-theme-light='false'] your-ui-class {
    background-color: black;
  }
  ```

  The theme name can also be targeted by writing CSS rules for
  `data-theme-name`.
  ([#5078](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5078))

- The `IThemeManager` interface now exposes a signal for
  `themeChanged`, allowing extension authors to react to changes in
  the theme. Theme extensions must also provide a new boolean property
  `isLight`, declaring whether they are broadly light colored. This
  data allows third-party extensions to react better to the active
  application theme.
  ([#5078](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5078))

- Added a patch to update the `uploads` for each `FileBrowserModel`
  instantly whenever a file upload errors. Previously, the upload that
  erred was only being removed from uploads upon an update. This would
  allow the status bar component and other extensions that use the
  `FileBrowserModel` to be more precise.
  ([#5077](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5077))

- Cell IDs are now passed in the shell message as part of the cell
  metadata when a cell is executed. This helps in developing reactive
  kernels.
  ([#5033](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5033))

- The IDs of all deleted cells since the last run cell are now passed
  as part of the cell metadata on execution. The IDs of deleted cells
  since the last run cell are stored as `deletedCells` in
  `NotebookModel`. This helps in developing reactive kernels.
  ([#5037](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5037))

- The `ToolbarButton` in `apputils` has been refactored with an API
  change and now uses a React component `ToolbarButtonComponent` to
  render its children. It is now a `div` with a single `button` child,
  which in turn as two `span` elements for an icon and text label.
  Extensions that were using the `className` options should rename it
  as `iconClassName`. The `className` options still exists, but it
  used as the CSS class on the `button` element itself. The API
  changes were done to accommodate styling changes to the button.
  ([#5117](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117))

- The `Toolbar.createFromCommand` function has been replaced by a
  dedicated `ToolbarButton` subclass called `CommandToolbarButton`,
  that wraps a similarly named React component.
  ([#5117](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117))

- The design and styling of the right and left sidebars tabs has been
  improved to address
  [#5054](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/50). We are
  now using icons to render tabs for the extensions we ship with
  JupyterLab and extension authors are encouraged to do the same (text
  labels still work). Icon based tabs can be used by removing
  `widget.caption` and adding
  `widget.iconClass = '<youriconclass> jp-SideBar-tabIcon';`.
  ([#5117](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117))

- The style of buttons in JupyterLab has been updated to a borderless
  design.
  ([#5117](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117))

- A new series of helper CSS classes for styling SVG-based icons at
  different sizes has been added: `jp-Icon`, `jp-Icon-16`,
  `jp-Icon-18`, `jp-Icon-20`.

- The rank of the default sidebar widget has been updated. The main
  change is giving the extension manager a rank of `1000` so that it
  appears at the end of the default items.

- Python 3.5+ is now required to use JupyterLab. Python 2 kernels can
  still be run within JupyterLab.
  ([#5119](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5119))

- JupyterLab now uses `yarn 1.9.4` (aliased as `jlpm`), which now
  allows uses to use Node 10+.
  ([#5121](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5121))

- Clean up handling of `baseUrl` and `wsURL` for `PageConfig` and
  `ServerConnection`.
  ([#5111](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5111))

### Other Changes

- Added the pipe (`|`) character as a CSV delimiter option.
  ([#5112](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5112))
- Added `Open From Path...` to top level `File` menu.
  ([#5108](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5108))
- Added a `saveState` signal to the document context object.
  ([#5096](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5096))
- Added "Copy Download Link" to context menu for files.
  ([#5089](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5089))
- Extensions marked as `deprecated` are no longer shown in the
  extension manager.
  ([#5058](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5058))
- Remove `In` and `Out` text from cell prompts. Shrunk the prompt
  width from 90px to 64px. In the light theme, set the prompt colors
  of executed console cells to active prompt colors and reduced their
  opacity to 0.5. In the dark theme, set the prompt colors of executed
  console cells to active prompt colors and set their opacity to 1.
  ([#5097](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5097) and
  [#5130](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5130))

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in the rendering of the "New Notebook" item of the
  command palette.
  ([#5079](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5079))
- We only create the extension manager widget if it is enabled. This
  prevents unnecessary network requests to `npmjs.com`.
  ([#5075](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5075))
- The `running` panel now shows the running sessions at startup.
  ([#5118](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5118))
- Double clicking a file in the file browser always opens it rather
  than sometimes selecting it for a rename.
  ([#5101](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5101))

### No longer in beta

In JupyterLab 0.33, we removed the "Beta" label to better signal that
JupyterLab is ready for users to use on a daily basis. The extension
developer API is still being stabilized. See the release blog post for
details.
([#4898](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4898),
[#4920](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4920))

### Workspaces

We added new workspace support, which enables you to have multiple saved
layouts, including in different browser windows. See the
`workspace documentation` for more details.
([#4502](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4502),
[#4708](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4708),
[#4088](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4088),
[#4041](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4041)
[#3673](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3673),
[#4780](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4780))

### Menu items

- "Activate Previously Used Tab" added to the Tab menu
  (`Ctrl/Cmd Shift '`) to toggle between the previously active tabs in
  the main area.
  ([#4296](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4296))
- "Reload From Disk" added to the File menu to reload an open file
  from the state saved on disk.
  ([#4615](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4615))
- "Save Notebook with View State" added to the File menu to persist
  the notebook collapsed and scrolled cell state. We now read the
  `collapsed`, `scrolled`, `jupyter.source_hidden` and
  `jupyter.outputs_hidden` notebook cell metadata when opening.
  `collapsed` and `jupyter.outputs_hidden` are redundant and the
  initial collapsed state is the union of both of them. When the state
  is persisted, if an output is collapsed, both will be written with
  the value `true`, and if it is not, both will not be written.
  ([#3981](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3981))
- "Increase/Decrease Font Size" added to the text editor settings
  menu. ([#4811](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4811))
- "Show in File Browser" added to a document tab's context menu.
  ([#4500](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4500))
- "Open in New Browser Tab" added to the file browser context menu.
  ([#4315](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4315))
- "Copy Path" added to file browser context menu to copy the
  document's path to the clipboard.
  ([#4582](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4582))
- "Show Left Area" has been renamed to "Show Left Sidebar" for
  consistency (same for right sidebar).
  ([#3818](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3818))

### Keyboard shortcuts

- "Save As..." given the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd Shift S`.
  ([#4560](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4560))
- "Run All Cells" given the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd Shift Enter`.
  ([#4558](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4558))
- "notebook:change-to-cell-heading-X" keyboard shortcuts (and
  commands) renamed to "notebook:change-cell-to-heading-X" for
  X=1...6. This fixes the notebook command-mode keyboard shortcuts for
  changing headings.
  ([#4430](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4430))
- The console execute shortcut can now be set to either `Enter` or
  `Shift Enter` as a Console setting.
  ([#4054](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4054))

### Command palette items

- "Notebook" added to the command palette to open a new notebook.
  ([#4812](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4812))

- "Run Selected Text or Current Line in Console" added to the command
  palette to run the selected text or current line from a notebook in
  a console. A default keyboard shortcut for this command is not yet
  provided, but can be added by users with the
  `notebook:run-in-console` command. To add a keyboard shortcut
  `Ctrl G` for this command, use the "Settings" | "Advanced Settings
  Editor" menu item to open the "Keyboard Shortcuts" advanced
  settings, and add the following JSON in the shortcut JSON object in
  the User Overrides pane (adjust the actual keyboard shortcut if you
  wish).
  ([#3453](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3453),
  [#4206](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4206),
  [#4330](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4330))

  ```json
  {
    "command": "notebook:run-in-console",
    "keys": ["Ctrl G"],
    "selector": ".jp-Notebook.jp-mod-editMode"
  }
  ```

- The command palette now renders labels, toggled state, and keyboard
  shortcuts in a more consistent and correct way.
  ([#4533](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4533),
  [#4510](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4510))

### Settings

- "fontFamily", "fontSize", and "lineHeight" settings added to the
  text editor advanced settings.
  ([#4673](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4673))
- Solarized dark and light text editor themes from CodeMirror.
  ([#4445](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4445))

### Larger file uploads

- Support for larger file uploads (>15MB) when using Jupyter notebook
  server version >= 5.1.
  ([#4224](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4224))

### Extension management and installation

- New extension manager for installing JupyterLab extensions from npm
  within the JupyterLab UI. You can enable this from the Advanced
  Settings interface.
  ([#4682](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4682),
  [#4925](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4925))
- Please note that to install extensions in JupyterLab, you must use
  NodeJS version 9 or earlier (i.e., not NodeJS version 10). We will
  upgrade yarn, with NodeJS version 10 support, when a [bug in
  yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5935) is fixed.
  ([#4804](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4804))

### Interface changes

- Wider tabs in the main working area to show longer filenames.
  ([#4801](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4801))
- Initial kernel selection for a notebook or console can no longer be
  canceled: the user must select a kernel.
  ([#4596](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4596))
- Consoles now do not display output from other clients by default. A
  new "Show All Kernel Activity" console context menu item has been
  added to show all activity from a kernel in the console.
  ([#4503](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4503))
- The favicon now shows the busy status of the kernels in JupyterLab.
  ([#4361](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4361),
  [#3957](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3957),
  [#4966](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4966))

### Renderers

- JupyterLab now ships with a Vega4 renderer by default (upgraded from
  Vega3).
  ([#4806](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4806))
- The HTML sanitizer now allows some extra tags in rendered HTML,
  including `kbd`, `sup`, and `sub`.
  ([#4618](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4618))
- JupyterLab now recognizes the `.tsv` file extension as tab-separated
  files.
  ([#4684](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4684))
- Javascript execution in notebook cells has been re-enabled.
  ([#4515](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4682))

### Changes for developers

- A new signal for observing application dirty status state changes.
  ([#4840](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4840))
- A new signal for observing notebook cell execution.
  ([#4740](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4740),
  [#4744](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4744))
- A new `anyMessage` signal for observing any message a kernel sends
  or receives.
  ([#4437](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4437))
- A generic way for different widgets to register a "Save with extras"
  command that appears in the File menu under save.
  ([#3981](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3981))
- A new API for removing groups from a JupyterLab menu. `addGroup` now
  returns an `IDisposable` which can be used to remove the group.
  `removeGroup` has been removed.
  ([#4890](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4890))
- The `Launcher` now uses commands from the application
  `CommandRegistry` to launch new activities. Extension authors that
  add items to the launcher will need to update them to use commands.
  ([#4757](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4757))
- There is now a top-level `addToBottomArea` function in the
  application, allowing extension authors to add bottom panel items
  like status bars.
  ([#4752](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4752))
- Rendermime extensions can now indicate that they are the default
  rendered widget factory for a file-type. For instance, the default
  widget for a markdown file is a text editor, but the default
  rendered widget is the markdown viewer.
  ([#4692](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4692))
- Add new workspace REST endpoints to `jupyterlab_server` and make
  them available in `@jupyterlab/services`.
  ([#4841](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4841))
- Documents created with a mimerenderer extension can now be accessed
  using an `IInstanceTracker` which tracks them. Include the token
  `IMimeDocumentTracker` in your plugin to access this. The
  `IInstanceTracker` interface has also gained convenience functions
  `find` and `filter` to simplify iterating over instances.
  ([#4762](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4762))
- RenderMime render errors are now displayed to the user.
  ([#4465](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4465))
- `getNotebookVersion` is added to the `PageConfig` object.
  ([#4224](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4224))
- The session `kernelChanged` signal now contains both the old kernel
  and the new kernel to make it easy to unregister things from the old
  kernel.
  ([#4834](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4834))
- The `connectTo` functions for connecting to kernels and sessions are
  now synchronous (returning a connection immediately rather than a
  promise). The DefaultSession `clone` and `update` methods are also
  synchronous now.
  ([#4725](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4725))
- Kernel message processing is now asynchronous, which guarantees the
  order of processing even if a handler is asynchronous. If a kernel
  message handler returns a promise, kernel message processing is
  paused until the promise resolves. The kernel's `anyMessage` signal
  is emitted synchronously when a message is received before
  asynchronous message handling, and the `iopubMessage` and
  `unhandledMessage` signals are emitted during asynchronous message
  handling. These changes mean that the comm `onMsg` and `onClose`
  handlers and the kernel future `onReply`, `onIOPub`, and `onStdin`
  handlers, as well as the comm target and message hook handlers, may
  be asynchronous and return promises.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- Kernel comm targets and message hooks now are unregistered with
  `removeCommTarget` and `removeMessageHook`, instead of using
  disposables. The corresponding `registerCommTarget` and
  `registerMessageHook` functions now return nothing.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The kernel `connectToComm` function is synchronous, and now returns
  the comm rather than a promise to the comm.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The `KernelFutureHandler` class `expectShell` constructor argument
  is renamed to `expectReply`.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The kernel future `done` returned promise now resolves to undefined
  if there is no reply message.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The `IDisplayDataMsg` is updated to have the optional `transient`
  key, and a new `IUpdateDisplayDataMsg` type was added for update
  display messages.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The `uuid` function from `@jupyterlab/coreutils` is removed. Instead
  import `UUID` from `@phosphor/coreutils` and use `UUID.uuid4()` .
  ([#4604](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4604))
- Main area widgets like the launcher and console inherit from a
  common `MainAreaWidget` class which provides a content area
  (`.content`) and a toolbar (`.toolbar`), consistent focus handling
  and activation behavior, and a spinner displayed until the given
  `reveal` promise is resolved. Document widgets, like the notebook
  and text editor and other documents opened from the document
  manager, implement the `IDocumentWidget` interface (instead of
  `DocumentRegistry.IReadyWidget`), which builds on `MainAreaWidget`
  and adds a `.context` attribute for the document context and makes
  dirty handling consistent. Extension authors may consider inheriting
  from the `MainAreaWidget` or `DocumentWidget` class for consistency.
  Several effects from these changes are noted below.
  ([#3499](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3499),
  [#4453](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4453))
  - The notebook panel `.notebook` attribute is renamed to
    `.content`.
  - The text editor is now the `.content` of a `DocumentWidget`, so
    the top-level editor widget has a toolbar and the editor itself
    is `widget.content.editor` rather than just `widget.editor`.
  - Mime documents use a `MimeContent` widget embedded inside of a
    `DocumentWidget` now.
  - Main area widgets and document widgets now have a `revealed`
    promise which resolves when the widget has been revealed (i.e.,
    the spinner has been removed). This should be used instead of
    the `ready` promise.

Changes in the JupyterLab code infrastructure include:

- The JupyterLab TypeScript codebase is now compiled to ES2015 (ES6)
  using TypeScript 2.9. We also turned on the TypeScript
  `esModuleInterop` flag to enable more natural imports from
  non-es2015 JavaScript modules. With the update to ES2015 output,
  code generated from async/await syntax became much more manageable,
  so we have started to use async/await liberally throughout the
  codebase, especially in tests. Because we use Typedoc for API
  documentation, we still use syntax compatible with TypeScript 2.7
  where Typedoc is used. Extension authors may have some minor
  compatibility updates to make. If you are writing an extension in
  TypeScript, we recommend updating to TypeScript 2.9 and targeting
  ES2015 output as well.
  ([#4462](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4462),
  [#4675](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4675),
  [#4714](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4714),
  [#4797](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4797))
- The JupyterLab codebase is now formatted using
  [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). By default the
  development environment installs a pre-commit hook that formats your
  staged changes.
  ([#4090](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4090))
- Updated build infrastructure using webpack 4 and better typing.
  ([#4702](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4702),
  [#4698](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4698))
- Upgraded yarn to version 1.6. Please note that you must use NodeJS
  version 9 or earlier with JupyterLab (i.e., not NodeJS version 10).
  We will upgrade yarn, with NodeJS version 10 support, when a [bug in
  yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5935) is fixed.
  ([#4804](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4804))
- Various process utilities were moved to `jupyterlab_server`.
  ([#4696](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4696))

### Other fixes

- Fixed a rendering bug with the Launcher in single-document mode.
  ([#4805](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4805))
